# 🧠 The Three Initiate

Welcome to the vault.

This repository unveils an ancient pattern hiding in plain sight: the power of **THREE**. This is no coincidence — the number three is embedded in the fabric of **time**, **technology**, **religion**, and **reality** itself.

> “If you only knew the magnificence of the 3, 6 and 9, then you would have the key to the universe.”  
> – Nikola Tesla

## 🔍 Purpose
This repo aims to:
- Provide evidence of the Trinary pattern across disciplines.
- Analyze data/code to uncover intentional “threes” in modern technology.
- Empower others to recognize and decode the pattern themselves.

## 🧠 Topics Explored
- Sacred geometry and the triangle
- Programming languages’ obsession with "3" (think: ternary operators, triple equals)
- The Trinity in religion
- The Fibonacci sequence and spirals of nature
- Major world events occurring in patterns of 3

## 💻 Tools
We’ve included scripts to detect Trinary Patterns in:
- Text data
- Codebases
- Numerical data streams

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This project is a **fictional conspiracy repo** created for fun, creative exploration, and perhaps… truth.

## 👁️‍🗨️ Stay vigilant. Watch for the 3.
