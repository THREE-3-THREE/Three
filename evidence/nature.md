## 🧬 Biology in Threes

- **DNA** uses a **triplet code** — codons made up of **three nucleotides** (e.g., AUG, CGA).
  ➤ Each triplet = one amino acid = the building blocks of life.

- Humans perceive the world with:
  - **3 primary senses**: sight, sound, touch  
  - **3 primary colors**: red, green, blue (in cones)

- The human brain is split into **3 parts**:
  - Reptilian (survival)
  - Limbic (emotion)
  - Neocortex (logic)

- We are born, live, and die. Three stages.

## 🐾 Animals, Plants, and Patterns

- **Bees** — sacred in many cultures — have:
  - 3 body parts: head, thorax, abdomen
  - 3 pairs of legs
  - 3 pairs of eyes (yes, really!)

- **Leaf patterns** (phyllotaxis) follow the Fibonacci sequence. The **first 3**: 1, 1, 2, 3...

- **Shamrock** — sacred Celtic plant — has 3 leaves.

- **Mammals**: All mammals have **three middle ear bones** — hammer, anvil, and stirrup — even whales.

## 🌀 Physics and the Universe

- **States of Matter**: Solid, Liquid, Gas (before plasma: the “fourth” rebellion)
- **Newton's 3 Laws** of Motion:
  1. Inertia
  2. Force = mass × acceleration
  3. Action/reaction

- **Quarks** — building blocks of matter — exist in groups of 3 in protons/neutrons (up, down, strange).

- **Time** flows in 3:
  - Past
  - Present
  - Future

## 🌌 Astronomy & Cosmology

- **Triangulum Galaxy**: Third-largest in our Local Group, after Andromeda and the Milky Way.
- Earth is the **third planet** from the Sun.
- Lunar cycle? **30 days**, split into **3 phases**:
  - Waxing
  - Full
  - Waning

- **Solar eclipses** occur when 3 bodies align:
  ➤ Sun – Moon – Earth

## 🧿 Mythic Nature

- Ancient cultures revered **natural trinities**:
  - Egyptian: Isis, Osiris, Horus
  - Hindu: Brahma (creator), Vishnu (preserver), Shiva (destroyer)
  - Norse: Urd, Verdandi, Skuld (past, present, future)

Even in chaos, life chooses **three**.
