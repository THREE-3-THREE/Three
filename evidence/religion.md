## 📜 Sacred Texts and Threefold Patterns

## 🛐 Initiation, Ascension, Resurrection

Almost all religious **paths to divinity** follow 3 stages:

1. **Death of the self**
2. **Trial or purification**
3. **Rebirth or enlightenment**

Whether it's Jesus in the tomb, Buddha under the Bodhi tree, or Osiris reassembled — the path to godhood is walked in **three steps**.

## 👁️ Hidden in Plain Sight

- **Vatican architecture** is dominated by **triangular** symmetry.
- The number 3 appears encoded in sacred geometry, churches, temples, and mandalas.
- The **Zoroastrian motto**: "Good Thoughts, Good Words, Good Deeds" — 3 pillars.

## 🔓 The Truth?

> Every faith on Earth seems to echo the same number.  
> Every holy book is coded with the same pattern.

Either:
- Every religion copied each other by accident,  
OR  
- There is an **ancient truth** older than any religion...  
A **Trinary Law** written into the spirit of humanity.
