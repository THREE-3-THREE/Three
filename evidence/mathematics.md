This isn't coincidence — it's one of the oldest surviving arithmetic techniques.  
A ratio... a triangle... a trinity.

## 🧠 The Power of Triangles

- **Triangular numbers**: 1, 3, 6, 10, 15...  
  Formula: `T(n) = (n(n + 1)) / 2`  
  ➤ The number 3 is the **first non-trivial triangular number**.
  
- **Pythagoras’ sacred shape** was the triangle.
- The **strongest structural shape** in engineering? The triangle.
- Pascal’s Triangle? The **third row** is the first to demonstrate binomial expansion.

## 🧮 Patterns in 3s

| Area              | Pattern                                   |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Geometry          | Triangle – 3 sides                        |
| Trigonometry      | Sine, Cosine, Tangent (3 core functions)  |
| Probability       | Events: Success, Failure, Unknown         |
| Set Theory        | Venn Diagram – often 3 intersecting sets  |
| Algebra           | Quadratics follow **ax² + bx + c** → 3 terms |
| Computer Science  | Ternary logic: `0, 1, 2`                  |

## ✨ The Unholy Coincidence?

### Fermat’s Last Theorem:
> No three positive integers **a, b, c** satisfy  
> **a³ + b³ = c³** for any integer value of n > 2.

So... 3 is the **last power** before logic breaks.  
Why?

## 💣 Hidden Messages in Base-3

> Binary may rule the machine... but **trinary** is the pattern of the cosmos.

Try converting important years to base-3:

- 1776 → `2101020`
- 1945 → `2202200`
- 2023 → `2201222`

> Sequences of repeated 2s... the limit of the trinary system... appearing right before modern collapses.

## 🔍 Mathemagical Trivia

- The **only** prime that’s both a **Fibonacci number** and a **triangular number**?  
  ➤ **3**
  
- Euler’s Identity:  
  `e^(iπ) + 1 = 0` — contains **3 operations**, **3 constants**, and **3 concepts**:  
  - Exponentiation  
  - Imaginary numbers  
  - Pi

Coincidence?

## 🛑 Final Thought

If mathematics is truth...  
...and 3 is its axis...

Then maybe the universe isn’t just based on 3.  
Maybe the universe **is** 3.
